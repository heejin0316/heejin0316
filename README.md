# Hello, I'm Heejin Jeong!

## About Me

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Ewha Womans University, and I'm interested in designing and building user experiences with a focus on frontend development.  
In particular, I'm passionate about creating interactions that users can understand and trust from an HCI perspective, and I'm exploring how AI/ML can be applied by actively studying them.  
I'm also an active member of GDG and Eoruon (an AI community), where I continuously expand my skills through projects and study groups.
