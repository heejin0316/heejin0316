## About Me
I'm currently an undergraduate student at Ewha Womans University, and I'm interested in designing and building user experiences with a focus on frontend development.  
In particular, I'm passionate about creating interactions that users can understand and trust from an HCI perspective, and I'm exploring how AI/ML can be applied by actively studying them.  
I'm also an active member of GDG and Eoruon (an AI community), where I continuously expand my skills through projects and study groups.

## Awards
- **BMW Korea Foundation – Young Innovator Dream Project 2025**: **Honorable Mention (Top 10)**, showcased at the Seongsu pop-up exhibition.

## Projects
- **EcoTrail (Android App)**: A React Native (Expo) app that helps drivers understand and reduce tire wear particles (TWP) by combining **GPS-based driving data**, **weather/road-condition APIs**, and an **in-app calculation engine**, then visualizing results with an intuitive dashboard (e.g., “cigarettes” / “trees” equivalents).  
  Tech: React Native, TypeScript, Firebase, OpenWeatherMap, Overpass API | [GitHub](https://github.com/heejin0316/EcotrailApp) · [Expo Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/heejin0316/projects/tyre-dust-mvp/builds/1b832b74-7a1c-4613-9532-0c74e436b527)

- **EcoTrail (Interactive Driving Challenge)**: A 60-second Unity3D experience showcased at **BMW YIDP 2025 Seongsu pop-up**, designed to make environmental impact from driving habits tangible through a **data-driven scoring system** and **5-level feedback cards** (Green → Red), with keyboard/gamepad support.  
  Tech: Unity 3D, C#, New Input System

- **Pan!**: A narrative-driven Unity2D game featuring branching dialogues, minigames, and multi-endings. I implemented the **story flow & scene transitions** and built a robust **multi-language system** (KR/EN/ZH/KZ) with stable rendering via TextMeshPro + fallback fonts. *(Steam release pending)*  
  Tech: Unity2D, C# | [GitHub](https://github.com/muffinhead03/OrkaGame2025_1)

- **WeWha (Community for Ewha Students & International Students)**: A community service to help Korean and international students connect and settle in. I worked on **backend signup APIs**, defined a **consistent error response format**, and contributed to **UI/UX design** for matching flows.  
  Tech: Spring Boot, MySQL (RDS), AWS EC2 | [GitHub](https://github.com/ECC-WeWha/BackEnd) · [Website](https://wewha.netlify.app/)
