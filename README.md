## 🍅 About Me
I'm currently an undergraduate student at Ewha Womans University, and I'm interested in designing and building user experiences with a focus on frontend development.  
In particular, I'm passionate about creating interactions that users can understand and trust from an HCI perspective, and I'm exploring how AI/ML can be applied by actively studying them.  
I'm also an active member of GDG and Eoruon (an AI community), where I continuously expand my skills through projects and study groups.

## 🏆 Awards
- **BMW Korea Foundation – Young Innovator Dream Project 2025**: **Honorable Mention (Top 10)**, showcased at the Seongsu pop-up exhibition.

## 🐟 Projects
- **EcoTrail (Android App)**: A React Native (Expo) app that helps drivers understand and reduce tire wear particles (TWP) by combining **GPS-based driving data**, **weather/road-condition APIs**, and an **in-app calculation engine**, then visualizing results with an intuitive dashboard (e.g., “cigarettes” / “trees” equivalents).  
  Tech: React Native, TypeScript, Firebase, OpenWeatherMap, Overpass API | [GitHub](https://github.com/heejin0316/EcotrailApp) · [Expo Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/heejin0316/projects/tyre-dust-mvp/builds/1b832b74-7a1c-4613-9532-0c74e436b527)

- **EcoTrail (Interactive Driving Challenge)**: A 60-second Unity3D experience showcased at **BMW YIDP 2025 Seongsu pop-up**, designed to make environmental impact from driving habits tangible through a **data-driven scoring system** and **5-level feedback cards** (Green → Red), with keyboard/gamepad support.  
  Tech: Unity 3D, C#, New Input System

- **Level Crossing Classification (Kaggle)**: Built an end-to-end CV pipeline to detect **stopped vehicles on a railway level crossing**. Used a **7-channel input** (t-2s frame + t frame + rail segmentation mask) and customized **ResNet18** to regress **15 targets** (up to 3 vehicles: existence probability + bounding box parameters). Achieved **Team Public Score 0.09764** and **Individual Public/Private 0.13258 / 0.16120**.  
  Tech: Python, PyTorch, Torchvision (ResNet18), OpenCV, Pandas/NumPy, scikit-learn, Pillow (PIL), tqdm | [GitHub (Personal)](https://github.com/heejin0316/Rail-Crossing-AI-Project) · [GitHub (Team)](https://github.com/GDGoC-Ewha-AI-Team1/AI-model_ResNet18-7ch) · [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vehicle-stopped-on-a-level-crossing)  

- **Pan!**: A narrative-driven Unity2D game featuring branching dialogues, minigames, and multi-endings. I implemented the **story flow & scene transitions** and built a robust **multi-language system** (KR/EN/ZH/KZ) with stable rendering via TextMeshPro + fallback fonts. *(Steam release pending)*  
  Tech: Unity2D, C# | [GitHub](https://github.com/muffinhead03/OrkaGame2025_1)

- **WeWha (Community for Ewha Students & International Students)**: A community service to help Korean and international students connect and settle in. I worked on **backend signup APIs**, defined a **consistent error response format**, and contributed to **UI/UX design** for matching flows.  
  Tech: Spring Boot, MySQL (RDS), AWS EC2 | [GitHub](https://github.com/ECC-WeWha/BackEnd) · [Website](https://wewha.netlify.app/)
